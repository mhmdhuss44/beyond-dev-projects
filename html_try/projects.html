            <h3>Software Engineering Project</h3>
            <p>During Software Engineering course, my teammates and I
                produced a project called “Flowers Shop”, as part of the course
                duties, where we created an e-shop for selling flowers online. The
                project was written in Java, involving JavaFx, clients/server
                interaction and SQL database.
